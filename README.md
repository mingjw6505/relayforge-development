# RelayForge Development Plugin

Reusable software development workflows for RelayForge projects across Codex,
Claude Code, ChatGPT, and compatible agent hosts.

## Layout

- `plugin.json` — portable Agent Plugins manifest.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex compatibility manifest.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Claude Code manifest.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — repo marketplace manifest for Codex/ChatGPT.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Claude Code marketplace manifest.
- `skills/` — reusable workflows, one directory per skill.
- `AGENTS.md` — repository guidance for Codex contributors.

## Add a skill

Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with front matter like:

```md
---
name: example-workflow
description: A concise description of when this workflow should activate.
---

Describe the workflow, inputs, outputs, boundaries, and verification steps.
```

Keep skills focused on one recognizable user goal. Add `scripts/`, `references/`,
or `assets/` inside the skill directory only when the workflow needs them.

## Validate

```bash
python3 -m json.tool plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .codex-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
```

No MCP server, hooks, credentials, or runtime dependencies are configured.

## Install from this repository

When adding this GitHub repository as a marketplace, use:

```text
https://github.com/mingjw6505/relayforge-development
```

The repository includes marketplace manifests that point to the root plugin
package. If the desktop app cached the previous invalid marketplace, remove or
refresh that marketplace and add the repository again.
